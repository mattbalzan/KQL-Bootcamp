What is KQL?
KQL, or Kusto Query Language, is a query language used to retrieve and analyze data from Azure Data Explorer (ADX) and other Microsoft services like Microsoft Sentinel, Log Analytics, and Application Insights.

KQL is optimized for fast, scalable data exploration and is particularly powerful for log and telemetry data analysis. It allows users to perform complex queries, aggregations, and visualizations with high efficiency.

Origin of the Name "Kusto"
The name Kusto comes from the famous explorer "Jacques Cousteau", known for his pioneering underwater exploration. Microsoft chose this name as a metaphor for "exploring the depths of data", similar to how Cousteau explored the depths of the ocean.
